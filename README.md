# Advanced Data Structures Library

### What is the purpose of this project?

> This project is a C# class library which contains the implementations of various advanced data structures and algorithms.

### What are the advanced data structures that are currently implemented in this library?

> 1. The <b>PositionalList ADT</b>, implemented with a <b>Doubly Linked List</b> structure.
> 2. The <b>Map ADT</b>, implemented with a <b>Hash Table</b> structure using separating chaining for collision handling with a positional list used as a secondary storage for entries mapping to the same hash value.
> 3. The <b>Graph ADT</b>, implemented with the <b>Adjacency Map</b> structure, with each vertex maintaining a secondary hash map for storing incident edges.

### Which algorithms are implemented in this library?

> 1. __Depth-First Search__ graph traversal.
> 2. Pattern-matching using __Brute Force__ algorithm.
